			<span id="s1">Everything I wanted</span>
			<section>I had a dream
I got everything I wanted
Not what you'd think
And if I'm being honest

It might have been a nightmare
To anyone who might care

Thought I could fly
So I stepped off the golden
Nobody cried
Nobody even noticed

I saw them standing right there
Kinda thought they might care

I had a dream
I got everything I wanted
But when I wake up, I see
You with me

And you say
As long as I'm here
No one can hurt you
Don't wanna lie here
But you can learn to
If I could change the way that you see yourself</section>

			<span id="s2">Outrunning Karma</span>
			<section>Outrunning karma that boy
He's such a charmer all the
Bugs and their larva follow
Him out to Colorado
Ten dozen hearts in a bag
Their bodies lying he'll drag
Them down to Colorado
A modern desperado

And he'll race for miles through the night
He runs because he knows he cannot hide

He's never gonna make it all the
Poor people he's forsaken karma
Is always gonna chase him for his lies
It's just a game of waiting from the
Church steeple down to Satan karma
There's really no escape until he dies

			<span id="s3">Safe and Sound</span>
			<section> I remember tears streaming down your face
When I said, "I'll never let you go"
When all those shadows almost killed your light
I remember you said, "Don't leave me here alone"
But all that's dead and gone and passed tonightJust close your eyes
The sun is going down
You'll be alright
No one can hurt you now
Come morning light
You and I'll be safe and sound</section>
